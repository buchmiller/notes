# 2023 Reading

Links to articles I read in 2023 with a few notes to remind me of the topic.

## January

[Get your work recognized: write a brag document](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/)

- "[These ideas] help me reflect on themes in my work, what’s important to me, what I’m learning, and what I’d like to be doing differently."
- "The tactic is pretty simple! Instead of trying to remember everything you did with your brain, maintain a “brag document” that lists everything so you can refer to it when you get to performance review season!"

[4 steps to transforming developers into security people](https://techbeacon.com/security/4-steps-transforming-developers-security-people)

- "To reach your developers with the message of security requires a four-phase process of application security connection. Open their eyes, fill their brains, task their hands, and embrace the gathering"

[Flaw: Constructor does Real Work](http://misko.hevery.com/code-reviewers-guide/flaw-constructor-does-real-work/)

- If it is difficult to test an object, the contructor might be doing too much.
- "Think about one fundamental question when writing or reviewing code: How am I going to test this?"
- "Do not create collaborators in your constructor, but pass them in" (builder, factory, provider, dependency injection, etc.)

## February

[Habits I've Developed for Fast + Efficient Programming](https://cprimozic.net/blog/programming-speed-strategies/)

- "The benefits of being fast and efficient at the actual mechanics of programming can have far-reaching benefits besides just the obvious ones of being able to do more work in less time.... All of these things have the goal of freeing up your time and more importantly your mental bandwidth to focus on the algorithms, interactions, abstractions, and business problems instead."

## March

[I'm a very slow thinker](https://sive.rs/slow)

- Take your time to think about a question and your answer before responding.
- "People say that your first reaction is the most honest, but I disagree. Your first reaction is usually outdated. Either it’s an answer you came up with long ago and now use instead of thinking, or it’s a knee-jerk emotional response to something in your past."

[Maybe you should do less 'work'](https://www.johnwhiles.com/posts/work)

- "You should try and figure out what expectations your colleagues and managers have of you. And also what you expect of yourself. If you can meet these expectations in fewer hours than you are supposed to work, then you shouldn't just find more to do. Instead you should do something different."
