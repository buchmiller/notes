# 2022 Reading

Links to articles I read in 2022 with a few notes to remind me of the topic.

[Meetings would go faster if people took the time to listen](https://hbr.org/2017/12/meetings-would-go-faster-if-people-took-the-time-to-listen)

- How to listen in meetings: 1. Understand what's being said. 2. Interpret what's been said. 3. Verify what's been said. 4. Consider how your point of view relates to what's been said.
- "Instead of hastily blurting out a counterargument, consider how your points relate to what has just been said.... Aim to make your response build on whatâ€™s been said, so it becomes a fuller discussion."
