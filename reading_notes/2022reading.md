# 2022 Reading

Links to articles I read in 2022 with a few notes to remind me of the topic.

## January

[Meetings would go faster if people took the time to listen](https://hbr.org/2017/12/meetings-would-go-faster-if-people-took-the-time-to-listen)

- How to listen in meetings: 1. Understand what's being said. 2. Interpret what's been said. 3. Verify what's been said. 4. Consider how your point of view relates to what's been said.
- "Instead of hastily blurting out a counterargument, consider how your points relate to what has just been said.... Aim to make your response build on what’s been said, so it becomes a fuller discussion."

[Agile Scrum is not working](https://iism.org/article/agile-scrum-is-not-working-51)

- Agile Scrum is often applied to many situations for which it doesn't fit well.
- "Technical leaders need a better understanding of R&D patterns – knowledge of why, how, and when to apply them."

[Developers can't fix bad management](https://iism.org/article/developers-can-t-fix-bad-management-57)

- "Traditional management needs to evolve; they should start by listening to what developers are saying management should do."
- "Predictive planning is used to organize known duration manufacturing and order fulfillment tasks, not software projects."
