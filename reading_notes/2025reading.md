# 2025 Reading

Links to articles I read in 2025 with a few notes to remind me of the topic.

## January

[Please Don't Force Dark Mode](https://iamvishnu.com/posts/please-dont-force-dark-mode)

- Dark mode on websites doesn't work for all situations.
- There are no accessibility guidelines for maximum contrast ratio.

[Ultimate guide to CI/CD: Fundamentals to advanced implementation](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/01/06/ultimate-guide-to-ci-cd-fundamentals-to-advanced-implementation/)

- "Perhaps most importantly, CI/CD fosters a culture of collaboration and transparency within software development teams. When everyone can see the status of builds, tests, and deployments in real time, it becomes easier to identify and resolve bottlenecks in the delivery process. The automation provided by CI/CD also reduces the cognitive load on developers, freeing them to focus on writing code rather than managing manual deployment processes."

[How do interruptions impact different software engineering activities?](https://rdel.substack.com/p/rdel-75-how-do-interruptions-impact)

- Suggestions include minimizing high-dominance interruptions, reducing interruptions during code writing, and measuring for improvement.
- "Reduce urgent notifications from authoritative figures during critical focus periods, unless urgent. Use scheduled check-ins instead."
- "Avoid interruptions during code writing, which has the highest stress correlation. This can be achieved using “Do Not Disturb” blocks within calendar and chat, and a culture that respects that time."
