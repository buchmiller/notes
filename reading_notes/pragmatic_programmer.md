# The Pragmatic Programmer

These are my personal reading notes and are mostly written in my own words. Please reference the book for the original text as intended by the authors.

## Chapter 1 - A Pragmatic Philosophy

Being a pragmatic programmer is about your attitude and how you approach various problems.

- Take responsibility. Acknowledge failures and shortcomings. Provide multiple options for how to resolve an issue.
- Software gets worse over time when left unmaintained. Leave the code better than you found it. Use common sense for how much time to spend.
- To help bring about change, actually do/build something - even just part of it. Make sure to do so gradually so it doesn't get rejected.
- Users should be involved in deciding what functionality is good enough. Share the trade-offs with them - the project can be done sooner if some errors are acceptable.
- Constantly build up and invest in your learning. The industry can change quickly, and our knowledge needs to stay relevant.
- Understand the audience when choosing when and how to communicate something with them.
