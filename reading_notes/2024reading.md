# 2024 Reading

Links to articles I read in 2024 with a few notes to remind me of the topic.

## January

[Talking to customers is not a waste of a developer's time](https://jeffgothelf.com/blog/talking-to-customers-is-not-a-waste-of-a-developers-time/)

- Customer research is often seen as a waste of developers' time, with the belief that their main job is to write code. However, delivering code does not necessarily mean delivering value to customers.
- Developers who talk to customers understand their problems and gain insights that help them write better code. This leads to higher success rates, less waste, and more meaningful features.
- Customer insight is crucial for creating valuable software and minimizing waste. A shift in mindset is needed to prioritize customer value in development processes.
