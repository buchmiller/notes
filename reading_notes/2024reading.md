# 2024 Reading

Links to articles I read in 2024 with a few notes to remind me of the topic.

## January

[Talking to customers is not a waste of a developer's time](https://jeffgothelf.com/blog/talking-to-customers-is-not-a-waste-of-a-developers-time/)

- Customer research is often seen as a waste of developers' time, with the belief that their main job is to write code. However, delivering code does not necessarily mean delivering value to customers.
- Developers who talk to customers understand their problems and gain insights that help them write better code. This leads to higher success rates, less waste, and more meaningful features.
- Customer insight is crucial for creating valuable software and minimizing waste. A shift in mindset is needed to prioritize customer value in development processes.

- Blogging helps clarify and articulate your thinking. Writing forces you to organize and make sense of your thoughts.
- It's a platform for sharing knowledge and ideas, as well as for practicing writing.
- "Almost every blog post I write teaches me something new, even if the detail doesn’t end up making it into the published post."

## March

[What Makes a Good Programmer?](https://henrikwarne.com/2014/06/30/what-makes-a-good-programmer/)

- Be able to break down complex problems.

- Understand existing code before making changes.

[UX, Then Architecture, Then Tools](https://morethancoding.com/2013/03/12/ux-then-architecture-then-tools/)

- "Many coders build their systems backwards. They become enamored with the latest whizz-bang framework or charmed by the reportedly speedy performance of the newest database. And they lead their thinking with those choices as they build new features, whether those technologies are appropriate or not."
- "Using a technology-first design typically means that the user experience (UX) will be left until last. And if you put your users last in your order of priorities, it will unfortunately be very evident in your system’s lack of usability."

[Scrum is dead: Breaking down the new open development method](https://opensource.com/business/15/11/open-development-method)

- "Although Scrum may have made more sense when it was being developed in the early '90s, much has changed over the years. ... As our workforce world evolves, our software development methods should evolve, too."
- "When you write code in a such a way that another developer half a world away can sit down and start working on it immediately, without needing to ask any questions, you're helping improve your team's efficiency."

[I'm A Developer Not A Compiler](https://www.blobstreaming.org/im-a-developer-not-a-compiler/)

[3 software development principles I wish I knew earlier in my career](https://thetshaped.dev/p/3-software-development-principles)

- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) - "Don’t add features or functionality to our software that we currently don’t need."
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) - "Don’t add unnecessary complexity to our software."
  - Even though adding layers of abstraction seems to contradict this, it helps hide complexity.
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) - "Don’t duplicate code or data in our software."
