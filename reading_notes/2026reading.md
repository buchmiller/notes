# 2026 Reading

Links to articles I read in 2025 with a few notes to remind me of the topic.

## January

[The Future of Software Development is Software Developers](https://codemanship.wordpress.com/2025/11/25/the-future-of-software-development-is-software-developers/)

- "The hard part of computer programming isn’t expressing what we want the machine to do in code. The hard part is turning human thinking... into computational thinking that is logically precise and unambiguous, and that can then be expressed formally in the syntax of a programming language."
- "The hard part has always been – and likely will continue to be for many years to come – knowing exactly what to ask for."

[Your Career Needs A Breaking Change](https://alifeengineered.substack.com/p/your-career-needs-a-breaking-change)

- Goals require knowing the end destination - which is often out of our control. What we can control is behavior (what we do). For example, we can't make ourselves get a promotion, but we can ensure we put in the effort to exceed expectations.
- "A goal is something you either achieve or you don’t. It is binary where you win or you lose. This is different. This is about changing how you approach your life and show up."

[Refactoring -- Not on the backlog!](https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/refactoring-not-on-the-backlog/)

- Has fun graphics on how it can often be more helpful to refactor code as part of feature development rather than as dedicated tasks.
