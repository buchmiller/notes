[Strong Opinions, Weakly Held](https://medium.com/@ameet/strong-opinions-weakly-held-a-framework-for-thinking-6530d417e364)

- "Allow your intuition to guide you to a conclusion, no matter how imperfect — this is the ‘strong opinion’ part. Then –and this is the ‘weakly held’ part– prove yourself wrong. Engage in creative doubt. Look for information that doesn’t fit, or indicators that pointing in an entirely different direction. Eventually your intuition will kick in and a new hypothesis will emerge out of the rubble, ready to be ruthlessly torn apart once again. You will be surprised by how quickly the sequence of faulty forecasts will deliver you to a useful result."
- Reasons it works well: "1. Leverage your team's collective wisdom. 2. Overcome your biases. 3. Have an on-demand decision."

[Why do we fall into the rewrite trap?](https://www.justindfuller.com/2020/01/why-do-we-fall-into-the-rewrite-trap/)

- "It's harder to read code than to write it." Don't rewrite because you don't understand it.
- Prefer refactoring over rewriting.
- Once you understand confusing code, refactor to make it easier for someone else to understand.
- Refactor before making other changes. "Make the change easy (warning: this may be hard), then make the easy change." -Kent Beck
- Only rewrite when better functionality is needed.
