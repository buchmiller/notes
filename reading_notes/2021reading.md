# 2021 Reading

Links to articles I read in 2021 with a few notes to remind me of the topic.

## January

[Estimates vs Actuals](https://industriallogic.com/blog/estimates-vs-actuals/)

- Story points can be more useful for showing amount of uncertainty than actual time estimates.
- "The problem isn't that you aren't good at estimation in general, but that the work has too much risk, uncertainty, delay, and interruption. We can't estimate our way to predictability."

[Technical Debt Isn't All Bad (Usually)](https://ryanhayes.net/technical-debt-isnt-all-bad-usually/)

- "Often, technical debt sold the software to allow you to have a job."
- "Strategic technical debt can bring you key wins at times that you can pay back later."

## February

[Stop Swiss Cheesing Your Calendar](https://thinkingthrough.substack.com/p/stop-swiss-cheesing-your-calendar)

- Schedule blocks of time dedicated to getting non-meeting work done.
