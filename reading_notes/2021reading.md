# 2021 Reading

Links to articles I read in 2021 with a few notes to remind me of the topic.

## January

[Estimates vs Actuals](https://industriallogic.com/blog/estimates-vs-actuals/)

- Story points can be more useful for showing amount of uncertainty than actual time estimates.
- "The problem isn't that you aren't good at estimation in general, but that the work has too much risk, uncertainty, delay, and interruption. We can't estimate our way to predictability."

[Technical Debt Isn't All Bad (Usually)](https://ryanhayes.net/technical-debt-isnt-all-bad-usually/)

- "Often, technical debt sold the software to allow you to have a job."
- "Strategic technical debt can bring you key wins at times that you can pay back later."

## February

[Stop Swiss Cheesing Your Calendar](https://thinkingthrough.substack.com/p/stop-swiss-cheesing-your-calendar)

- Schedule blocks of time dedicated to getting non-meeting work done.

[Technical Debt as a Lack of Understanding](https://daverupert.com/2020/11/technical-debt-as-a-lack-of-understanding/)

- Code should be reorganized to reflect new understanding that didn't exist when originally created.
- "You can't expect people to be productive in something that was a culmination of rushed code, poorly understood requirements, and shortcuts made by people who no longer work there."

[To Everyone Who Asks For 'Just A Little' Of Your Time: Here's What It Costs To Say Yes](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2017/01/to-everyone-who-asks-for-just-a-little-of-your-time/)

- "You can only hand so many hours of your day over to other people before there is none left. Even if there are some left, you may have lost the clarity, the energy and the capacity to do anything with them."
- "Time? Time is our most irreplaceable asset - we cannot buy more of it. We cannot get a second of it back. We can only hope to waste as little as possible. Yet somehow we treat it as most renewable of all resources."

## March

[When costs are nonlinear, keep it small](https://jessitron.com/2021/01/18/when-costs-are-nonlinear-keep-it-small/)

- Batching many changes together into a single large deploy increases the risk of the deploy and makes it difficult to pinpoint which change caused a problem.

## May

[Why Senior Engineers Hate Coding Interviews](https://medium.com/swlh/why-senior-engineers-hate-coding-interviews-d583d2855757)

- "They take a ton of prep time to nail... They push senior engineers to work differently... They don’t really test what you’ll want them to do once hired... They send a bad message..."

[Becoming a High-Performance Software Engineer](https://medium.com/riskified-technology/becoming-a-high-performance-software-engineer-895ec6949782)

- "An engineer’s day-to-day work... is an expected bar from all software engineers. To stand out and create a major impact requires more... such an engineer is someone who aims for excellence and to create an impact beyond their own individual work."
- Be engaged in meetings by being an active participant.
- Own the feature you work on by ensuring information is accurate and nothing got missed.
- "[Small or micro-refactors] should be performed constantly and so as to not delay our feature delivery time... In other words, align the areas of code you touch to high coding standards."
- "To stay relevant and excel, a high-performing engineer should always be passionate about learning and broadening his or her knowledge."
