# Design patterns

* Strategy Pattern - defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

* Observer Pattern - defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
