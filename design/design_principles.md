# Design Principles

## Encapsulate what varies

* Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.

## Program to interfaces, not implementations

## Favor composition over inheritance

## Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact

* Loosely coupled designs allow us to build flexible OO systems that can handle change because they minimize the interdependency between objects.

## Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification
